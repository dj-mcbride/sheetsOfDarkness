You can make a few calls and cut a few deals to get assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller will probably require you to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you.  Each Allies Trait possessed represents one person that you can call on for aid. Unlike Influence, your Allies have special talents that make them better than the average person on the street. Though your allies may not be aware of your vampire nature, they can be quite useful if directed properly.  In general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you can use them for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller:  Be wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual aid or refuse to help if pressed into dangerous or illegal activities.",

If you undertook a specific task previously, like tailing someone, researching a projector building a device, your allies can continue the work, doing so with one Ability Trait's worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project, your Allies Trait for the individual is tied up.",
            "If you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to gain access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each Allies Trait that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. They may use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and they only help as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner.",
            "An ally can help you to hunt, though obviously, it's not a good idea to rely on your allies as blood sources, or to even tell them exactly what they're doing when they bring people to you. Each Trait of Allies that you use for hunting lets you make a Simple Test. A win or tie grants you one additional Blood Trait. Doing so counts as a project that lasts for the entire time between game sessions."

Although having an "ear to the wall" doesn't necessarily provide you with good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know who to ask when looking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes.  In game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to discern rumors and information. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check with likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and information as if possessed of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you find out exactly what's going on in the city within a particular area. You can get information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If you use Contacts x 3 on Industry, for instance, you get information as if digging up dirt with Industry x 3 Influence. The advantage of the Contacts Background is that contacts can be switched from place to place each game, getting information in different areas at your demand.  Using Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require you to spend some money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of a Story accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as a strike that affects your Industry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical conjunction sends your Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will not generally function as aides or lackeys; that is the purview of the Allies and Retainers Backgrounds.",

Next month, he plans to use his contacts to find an Underworld buyer for his secrets. "

Though such notoriety often fades with the years, your Fame lingers on to influence mortal society.  Fame allows you to exercise your connections over a longer distance than usual. Certainly, if you've got the right Influence, you can push things around on an interstate or even national scale, but with Fame, you can just make a few calls and get your Contacts, Influence or Resources exerted over a greater range without any impediment. This is not to say you must have Fame to get anything done, only that it may help. Your total Fame determines your maximum range for unimpeded use of your Contacts, Influence and Resources.  When you make an effort to exert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over a long range, you lean on your popularity and image, thus expending your Fame Traits until the next game session. Fame is most often used in the downtime between sessions to facilitate long-range plans.  In a less mechanical fashion, your Fame also dictates how recognizable you are to mortals, for one reason or another. The Storyteller will certainly make the effects of your Fame apparent, and mortals may take notice of you at bothersome times. Being profile on \"America's Most Wanted\" or spotted at the Academy Awards does things to one's repuation, after all.  Fame does have its limitations. It makes little sense for you to have this Background if you're known to be dead in the mortal world. Also, Fame does not always indicate widespread instant name recognition; you may only be known to a subset of a particular group, or a recognized expert in a field who's unknown to those outside.",

Those Embraced by a sire closer in the chain to Caine and the Antediluvians find that their blood is strengthened by that proximity. The less scrupulous among the younger generations steal this power through the foul process of diablerie. Since a vampire's sheer power and eventual potential are limited by Generation, much of vampire society is ordered by those of low Generation (close to Caine) while the neonates of weak, thin blood and high Generation (many steps removed) champ at a bit that cannot be removed.  You must spend one Background or Free Trait for each Generation purchased. Thus, if your character is of the 10th generation, you must spend three Background or Free Traits for this privilege. The Storyteller may place a limit on how low the generation spread may go.  The total number of Traits placed in this Background determines your exact generation. You start at the 13th generation, and drop one generation for each Trait spent - thus, with five Traits of Generation, you are of the eighth generation removed from Caine. (You could theoretically have a \"negative generation\" by taking the Flaw Fourteenth Generation)  Your generation affords great power, for it determines your ultimate potential and raw potency of blood. However, being of low generation also makes you a tempting target for would-be diablerists, who seek to steal your vitae to enrich their own.",

You should work with your Storyteller to describe the exact nature of your herd, since these Traits can be lost through hazards or deliberate sabotage. You could have mortals who are conditioned to enjoy the Kiss, access to medical blood supplies outside of the normal channels or a religious cult that gives you blood freely. Each Trait of Herd can be used to gain one extra Blood Trait once per session. You can do this immediately on entering the game to represent that you have previously fed, thus improving your blood from your starting Traits for the evening (based on your Blood Test). You can also take 15 minutes out of play to call on a herd and gain a Blood Trait. You can split up Herd Traits if you wish, so you may use some Traits to start with extra blood, then use more later to replace spent vitae.  Members of your herd (assuming it is composed of people and not plastic bags) are not necessarily particularly competent or loyal - they simply let you feed from them.
