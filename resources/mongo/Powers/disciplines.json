By drawing on this feral connection, vampires can communicate with and control animals. Indeed, vampires who develop a communion with their animal side often seem attractive or at least masterful to most animals. This Discipline is practiced by the Gangrel, Nosferatu, Ravnos and Tzimisce clans; the Gangrel and Nosferatu often establish equitable or friendly relationships with natural creatures, while the Tzimisce show their mastery over lesser life forms through this power. Ravnos find animals to be useful scouts, spies and meals in their nomadic travels.",

Your predatory nature allows you to understand and cow natural creatures. Depending on your predilections, you may deal with the animal equitably, or you may demand obedience. The animal may not wish to obey, but this Discipline's power insures that the animal is at least favorably disposed toward you. Even if the animal is intractable, you may be able to force it into submission. Using this power requires that you look into the eyes of the creature with which you desire to communicate; if this gaze is lost, then you must attempt to re-establish contact if you wish to continue communicating. Most animals will continue to attend your gate while you are communicating with them, though. Animals without eyes, or very simple in nature, do not have enough of a mind or Beast to connect with easily. This power works best with predatory creatures and larger birds, reptiles and mammals.  You may communicate with animals without any test. However, to issue commands, you must defeat the animal in a Social Challenge - generally, the animal will have the equivalent of six to eight Traits for this challenge, as determined by a Narrator. If you succeed, you can count on the animal following your orders for the remainder of the evening. Most animals lack the intelligence necessary to carry out complex or conditional commands, but they can perform simple tasks like fetching, following people or guarding locations"

Different vampires evoke this power in different ways. Nosferatu most commonly soothe the Beasts of their subjects, drawing them into lassitude, while Tzimisce and Gangrel often assert their mastery over lesser subjects and terrify the victims into submission. Regardless of the means, the results are similar; any vampire using this Discipline can choose her particular style. No speech or vocalization is necessary -- only the physical or eye contact. You must engage in a Social Challenge with your victim in order to use this power. Once you have intimidated or soothed the subject, he may no longer use Willpower Traits for the remainder of the evening.

Cowing the Beast of a vampire is much more difficult. You must expenda Willpower Trait to make the attempt (before engaging in the Social Challenge). If successful, the vampire suffers from the normal effects of this power. Alternately, you may use this power on a vampire in frenzy, causing the Cainite to snapback into lucidity. In such a case, you expend the Willpower Trait and make the Social Challenge as usual, but if you succeed, the vampire merely returns to lucidity instead of suffering the other effects of this Discipline.

Your soul pushes aside the animal's weaker spirit, and your own body falls into a comatose state, while your spirit uses the animal as a vessel. Though influenced by the animal's bestial nature, you can still exercise your intellect and even some of your superatural capabilities.  You are limited by the physical constraints of any animal that you possess -- your physical Disciplines do not augment the creature, nor do you have the ability to speak or manipulate objects if that is normallyoutside of the animal's physical capabilities. However, you can use the animal's natural abilities, such as claws, wings poison and gills.  There is no functional limit to the distance at which you can exercise this Discipline once you have possessed an animal ---- you may move freely in the animal's body, even in sunlight (subject to the normal restrictions for remaining awake during the day), without concem for your vampiric form. However, you are not automatically aware of what transpires around your comatose body. Ifyour animal form suffers injury, your vampiric body suffers equal sympathetic injury, if the animal body is slain, your soul returns to your body and you enter torpor. Should you choose to leave the animal's body for your own, this happens regardless of distance as long as you are conscious. However, you must declare this intentat the beginning of the tum and survive until the end of the tum (if you are in combat or other dangerous situations). Fleeing the animal body does not require an action; you may still act normally in the tum that you intend to return to your body. If you are injured (without being knocked unconscious) while attempting to return to your own body, you must make a Simple Test -a tie indicates that you remain in the grip of animalistic behavior for the rest of the scene, and a failure causes you to immediately enter frenzy, though in both cases you return to your Cainite form automatically.  If your vampiric body dies while you inhabit an animal's form, you can try to remain in the animal body. Each sunrise, you must make a Simple Test (win ortie). If you lose your spirit plunges into the astral realms, gone forever. Thus, you have only a short time to survive.  Exercising this power requires that you gaze into the eyes of the beast that you intend to possess (if the animal has no eyes, you may not possess it). You must then expend Social Traits to move into the animal's body. The more Social Traits you choose to expend, the more complete your connection to the animal form. With simple possession, you direct the body as you choose; more complete dominance allows you to use some of your own Disciplines while in the body.  Once you have used this power, you suffer from some of the animal's habits and instincts. For each Social Trait expended on the possession, you suffer from one Negative Trait of Feral. These Traits remain until you overcome the animal's behavior patterns by expending Willpower Traits-one Willpower Trait for each Negative Trait removed. You should roleplay the animal's mannerisms, even after returning to your own body, until you have managed to remove these Negative Traits, although you can slowly overcome them by spending Willpower Traits over time (you need not try to overcome all of the Feral habits at once).",

Instead, you make a Social Challenge against any individual within your line of sight. Doing so does not cost an action; you may attempt this feat any time that you are about to frenzy. If you win, your frenzy is transferred to the victim. The hapless recipient immediately enters frenzy and even manifests some of your personality, habits and speech patterns (which should be roleplayed - typically, characters with the Investigation Ability may recognize your mannerisms in the victim). The victim remains in a normal frenzy, while you are unaffected and unable to frenzy for the duration. Should the victim die while frenzied, though, the screaming Beast immediately returns to you, requiring you to make a Virtue Test or to exercise this power again. If you lose, you instead frenzy immediately with no Virtue Test, and you are unable to fight against your frenzy with Willpower Traits.   While the Beast is loosed in a victim, you remain complacent and placid. However, if the victim leaves your sight before the frenzy is over, you lose your Beast, suffering as if subjected to Quell the Beast - you cannot use Willpower Traits and you gain the Negative Traits Submissive x 2.

    "Auspex" : {
        "description" : "A predator's senses must be fearfully acute, so many vampires hone their sensory talents to incredible sharpness. This improved awareness starts merely by expanding physical senses, but as a vampire's powers of perception grow, consciousness itself becomes fleeting and sublime. Such a heightened awareness encompasses subtle textures and emotional states, transcending the physical limitations of the body while developing sharpness of the mind.  The powers of Auspex grant the ability to see through supernatural deception. With such focused attention, Auspex can even pierce the veils of Chimerstry and Obfuscate. Whenever Auspex is active (a conscious choice on the vampire's part), a Mental Challenge may be made with an opponent to try to see through the illusions of Chimerstry or the misdirection of Obfuscate. Winning this challenge with Auspex penetrates the deceptive powers. Losing, though, indicates that the vampire is affected normally. For each level of difference between the subject's Obfuscate or Chimerstry and the searcher's Auspex, there is a Trait modifier on a one-for-one basis in the event of ties or overbids. For example, a searching vampire with Telepathy (an intermediate level of Auspex) counts two additional Traits against an opponent who only knows Unseen Presence, a Basic level of Obfuscate. This bonus applies even when not using the full level of these Disciplines; an individual hiding with Mask of a Thousand Faces is still very difficult to detect if his mastery of Obfuscate has reached the Advanced level of Cloak the Gathering, A chance to see through supernatural concealment always exists, but doing so is much more likely if the searcher's Auspex powers are highly advanced and/or the opponent's powers are weak. When using a Heightened Sense, hold up a number of fingers based on your power level (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for Advanced).  The Auspex Discipline is most evidenced by the Tremere, Tzimisce and Malkavian clans, who use it for supernatural insights, and by the Toreador, who use their superb senses in conjunction with their artistic work.  Auspex powers retest with the Investigation Ability. Willpower may be used for a single retest when attempting to spot an Obfuscated or otherwise hidden individual-in such a case, the vampire focuses his senses and concentrates fiercely, redoubling his searching efforts.",

Note that you may only use this power on objects or places, not on people, vampires, animals or other living creatures.  By touching an item and expending a Mental Trait for a turn of concentration, you gain a brief flash of insight into any powerfully emotional events surrounding the object in question. Each use of this power on an object allows you to ask a Narrator one of the following questions, requiring a truthful answer: Who last touched this object (before me)? Was this object used in any emotionally stressful events, like a murder, a passionate romance or a maniacal rage? What strong emotions drove a particular subject holding this object? Answers to these questions generally come in the form of images and impressions, you may not get exact names or lists of information, but instead distorted pictures, flashes of sudden passion and repeating sounds and voices.

You can link your consciousness to anyone you can see, sending or receiving concepts that you and the target 'hear' in your respective minds.  In order to use Telepathy, you must make a Mental Challenge against your subject. A willing subject may relent to this mental contact, but there is no way to identify the originator of a given telepathic missive short of making contact (or you choose to identify yourself). You must also spend a full turn in concentration, focusing on your subject. If you succeed, you establish a brief link, allowing you to send or scan thoughts as long as you maintain the contact. You may issue a stream of thoughts that the subject 'hears' as a single concept, or you can pluck a thought from the victim, asking a single question and demanding a truthful answer. Legitimate secrets that can be uncovered are anything that could be discerned with Aura Perception, as well as such questions as: What is the appearance of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What is the name of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What element have you omitted from your answer to a question, if any? What is the true answer to a question that you have lied about? What memories do you have of one topic (querent's choice) of current conversation? If you choose to interrogate an unwilling victim, you must make a Mental Challenge for each question asked: if simply communicating normally, no additional challenges are required.  With effort, you can probe deep into the consciousness of an open mind, drawing out hidden secrets or buried memories. Doing so allows you to ask more detailed questions than the cursory ones usually employed with Telepathy. By expending a Mental Trait after establishing a successful telepathic link, you may ask and expect a truthful response to: What is one of your Flaws or Negative Traits, if any (subject's choice)? What is one of your derangements if any (subject's choice)? Each question asked requires a Static Mental Challenge against the subject's Mental Traits, and the subject may not relent--you are delving deep into the mind, which reacts automatically to defend against intrusion.  At Storyteller discretion, Telepathy may discern clumsy uses of Dominate, particularly of Forgetful Mind, but with a great deal of effort. The most common means of doing so is to establish a link and begin asking questions, as described in the paragraph above. A second Static Mental Challenge against the subject's Mental Traits may allow you to spot gaps in a memory or where a memory has been poorly reconstructed. Modern vampires compare such gaps to be like watching a badly spliced film.  Communication with Telepathy proceeds in impulses, images and feelings, and it does not rely on the use of a common language, so even people who do not speak the same language may make themselves understood. Individuals unused to the sudden onslaught of Telepathy may be momentarily stunned or disoriented by projected thoughts, at the Narrator's discretion. Telepathy may also be used simply to eavesdrop, scanning someone telepathically is invisible and largely undetectable, unless another character with Telepathy tries to 'listen in on the link' (using a Static Mental Challenge against the scanner). Such eavesdropping can only be used on surface thoughts. Beware, thoughif you force your way into someone's mind without permission, the target may make a Willpower Challenge to force you to break off your link.  You may only use your Telepathy on one subject at a time, but this limit does not preclude someone else from using her own Telepathy on you. If you contact a subject and then use your Telepathy on someone else, your link to the first subject collapses and must be re-established later.  Using Telepathy on a supernatural creature is a taxing exercise, and it requires the expenditure of a Mental Trait. This Trait is expended before the Mental Challenge is made to establish the link. Telepathy only functions on beings with conscious thought. The Discipline has no effect on constructs that are not self-aware or on normal animals."

Without the concerns of mass and matter, you easily pass through any physical barrier and move at the speed of thought to any place on Earth, under the orbit of the moon.  While your senses are projected, your body lies in a comatose state, unaware of its surroundings. Your psychic form does not tire from travel, nor is it hindered or injured by the material world. Indeed, you are completely invisible and intangible, unable to affect anything physically. However, your spirit-form can still sense its surroundings normally, even using your other powers of Auspex. Your immaterial form is tied to your material corpse through a silver cord, a sort of psychic tether that keeps you fron becoming lost in the realms of spirit.

You may remain out of your body as long as you like, though the rise of the sun over your physical form may force you into slumber. Furthermore, by expending an additional Willpower Trait, you can manifest for a single turn as an intangible apparition, allowing you to be seen and to speak audibly. While materialized, you can use any of your Mental or Social Disciplines simply by expending a Mental Trait before making the appropriate additional expenditures or challenges. While visible, you appear as an idealised form of yourself, complete with projected trappings, though your real-world physical possessions do not come with you in spirit form. Even while visible, you remain intangible and thus immune to injury from conventional sources like claws, fire, sunlight and mundane weapons (although your comatose body can still be harmed). While in astral form, you may not possess other bodies, even if you have that talent in Dominate.  You may deal normally with other astral forms that you encounter, conversing and using Mental or Social Disciplines. You may even attempt to injure other astral travelers by attacking their silver cord. Such astral combat uses Mental Challenges, with damage causing the opponent to lose Willpower Traits. Once an astral combatant runs out of Willpower Traits, his silver cord snaps, stranding him in the spirit realms. From there, the spirit may accidentally wander deeper into other worlds (such as the Dark Umbra in Oblivion or the Realms described in Laws of the Wild), or he may stumble about until he finds a way to return to his body. Some spirits thus trapped never return, captured or devoured by monstrous entities that dwell in the astral plane.  While astral, your consciousness exists in a mental projection of the material world. You cannot directly interact with or see wraiths, Umbral spirits or Garou (see Oblivion and Laws of the Wild), unless you find a means to travel to or sense the other spirit worlds.

When angered, stressed or consumed with need, a Cainite can use the power inherent in the blood to fuel heractions, moving with startling quickness.  If attacked by surprise (see p.200), the victim may not use Celerity in the initial challenge - she must respond with her normal reflexes, and can only draw on her vampiric speed once she has reacted to the surprise.  The Celerity Discipline is most common among the Assamite, Brujah and Toreador clans. The former two tend to use the powers of Celerity in battle, while the latter engages in feats of dance, rapid completion of artwork or to flee from danger.  Since Celerity simply grants additional actions or modifiers to speed, it does not draw retests from any Ability. Actions performed with Celerity can still be retested appropriately (if shooting a gun twice, for instance, Firearms is used normally for a retest on each shot). Additional actions with Celerity can only be used for physical feats; one cannot use rapidfire Dominate or Thaumaturgy with Celerity, for instance. As a general rule, Mental and Social Disciplines may not be activated during Celerity, except during Alacrity.  Use of Celerity at the speed of Swiftness or above is generally considered a breach of the Masquerade.

When performing an action where speed is of the essence, such as dodging an attack, throwing a knife or grabbing something out of someone's hand, you can declare that you have Rapidity.

You may use Rapidity in any challenge where you rely on your own speed, even if your opponent attempts to use strength or stamina. Thus, if you try to use your Rapidity to dodge out of the way of someone grabbing at you, you can still use the Bomb.

You can cover, alter or erase memories, you must make a Mental Challenge against your victim.

Although you can remove, add or change memories, you cannot destroy a subject's actual capabilities. That is, you may remove all memory of a subject learning a particular Ability or Discipline, but the victim will still retain the capability in question - he may simply be unable to recall how and when he learned it. Forgetful Mind is most useful in changing someone's memories of an event (causing someone to forget your feeding, for instance) or to cover traces of other powers (removing someone's recollection of the use of Mesmerism, leavingan implanted command buried in the subconscious mind). Themore detailed your description, the more realistic the memory seems to your victim.  Use of Forgetful Mind can also determine if a particular set of memories is fake, by causing the subject to recall his overwritten experiences. By winning a Static Mental Challenge against the Mental Traits of the previous dominator, you can determine if certain memories are falsely implanted or changed, and you can then restore the original memories or alter the false ones as you see fit.

You need not make tests to Dominate such a victim; the subject follows your commands even if you cannot make eye contact. Furthermore, the subject gains one free retest against the Dominate powers of any other Cainites.  A victim of Conditioning has little free will or motivation, and he has trouble reacting to stimuli. As a result, such pawns cannot produce artistic works or engage in teaching; they lack the drive and flexibility to perform these sorts of tasks.  If an enslaved subject manages to avoid all contact with her master for six game sessions, minus one session for each Willpower Trait spent (minimum of one full session), then the Conditioning is shaken off and the subject reasserts her individuality. A drone may also bedeprogrammed by the successful use of this Discipline again just as if trying to enslave the subject.

During the course of Possession, you experience everything that happens to the mortal body, as you guide its actions. Your Cainite form also suffers any damage sustained by the mortal body; if the mortal body dies before your consciousness can flee, you immediately collapse into torpor. If you wish to flee the mortal body for your own corpse, you must announce your intent at the beginning of the turn, and your spirit does not leave until the end of the turn (although you may still perform actions as normal). As soon as you leave, the mortal resumes control over his body (assuming that he's still alive).  While in the mortal body, you may travel any distance from your unconscious Cainite form. You have all the capabilities of the living body; you can even survive daylight, if you manage to stay awake (see p. 111). The body is as vulnerable as any other mortal's, though. For this reason, most vampires use ghouls for Possession, relying on the inherent strength in such creatures.  If your vampiric body is slain while your consciousness resides in another body, you can try to hang onto the form. However, you must make a Simple Test (winor tie) at each sunrise.

Once Intermediate expertise is achieved, the student may expand into the studies of the Ash Path (communication with the Underworld) or the Bone Path (control of zombies) at the Basic levels, but he may learn only one of the two paths. At the Advanced level of mastery in the Sepulchre Path, the necromancer may begin studies of the other path as well, and he may improve beyond the Basic levels in any Necromancy path. Some few Cainite necromancers study more rare paths, or in a different order, but all Giovanni and Samedi vampires learn the Sepulchre Path first. ",

Indeed, powerful Salubri can apparently repair the very scars of the Beast on a Cainite's psyche. Of course, few would trust the Cyclops enough to undergo such treatment. As these powers irrevocably mark the user as a Salubri or ally of such, they are almost never seen or heard of by other vampires -no Salubri would give away his position to Cainites who might betray him to the Tremere, nor would he teach such fatal secrets to another.  Once a vampire leams the Basic power of Anesthetic Touch, he develops a third eye in the middle of his forehead. This eye opens anytime an Obeah power of Anesthetic Touch or higher is used. Cainite scholars speculate that the eye may, in some way, be connected with the mystical (or demonic) insight that grants this Discipline.  Retests of Obeah use the Medicine Ability.",

Three Mental Traits reveal the amount of blood in the subject's system, while four Mental Traits reveal any diseases.

Sense Vitality may also be used for medical diagnosis, determining the source of injuries or diseases afflicting a victim. Anything that could be learned with a medical examination the source of the injury, the wound's severity, the reason behind unnatural mental states or death - can be learned with a touch. Each condition examined in this fashion requires the expenditure of a Mental Trait.

You literally take the subject's soul into communion with your own, soothing the psychic scars and trauma that afflicts the victim. Though you cannot remove the Curse of Caine from a subject, you can heal the most terrible emotional trauma that weighs down most vampires.  When you remove a soul for healing with Unburdening the Bestial Soul, the subject's body is devoid of consciousness. As a result, the empty shell cannot be affected by Mental or Social Disciplines, as there is no personality to affect. However, it does make a perfect host for wandering spirits or ghosts. Unless possessed by an outside consciousness, the body automatically follows your simple verbal commands as long as you hold the soul. Without free will, though, the body cannot perform any task but autonomic functions unless you direct it specifically.  Unburdening the Bestial Soul functions only on a willing subject, and you must make eye contact with the target. Then, you make a Static Physical Challenge against the subject--the difficulty is two Traits for every Humanity/Path Trait that the subject falls below six (a subject with three Humanity Traits, for instance, has a static difficulty of six Traits). This power only functions on vampires with Humanity Traits, or on the Paths of Harmony or Honorable Accord, and it cannot affect a subject who has no remaining Humanity/ Path Traits.  Once you remove a subject's soul, you can expend permanent Willpower Traits to restore Humanity/ Path Traits on a Trait-for-Trait basis. You can restore the subject up to the normal maximum of five Traits.  If you fail to care for the subject's body while holding the soul, or try to hold the soul after the subject wants to return to his body, you risk losing your own Humanity (make a Conscience/Conviction Virtue Test, difficulty four Traits). The soul can make a Mental Challenge against you once per night to break free in such a case.  You cannot use Unburdening the Bestial Soul to restore your own Humanity/Path Traits"

    "Obfuscate" : {
        "description" : "As creatures of cunning, intrigue and misdirection, Cainites possess an uncanny knack for deception and stealth. For some, though, this ability goes far beyond normal subterfuge. Such vampires actually cloud the minds of people around them, dulling notice and directing attention elsewhere. As a result, these vampires can remain obscured from observation, perhaps even extending their concealing powers to other objects and people.  The powers of Obfuscate are often employed by the Assamites in their assassination work, and by the Followers of Set, who surreptitiously ferret out secrets and watch over their quarry. Malkavians use this power to escape notice when engaged in their insane activities. The undisputed masters of this Discipline, though, are the Nosferatu, who use its mind-numbing powers to gather secrets and hide their fearful countenances.  Because Obfuscate clouds the awareness of its targets, they avoid notice of a concealed individual and to rationalize away such attention unless it is forced on them. Thus, if a vampire is concealed with this Discipline while wandering about a room, people avoid her subconsciously. If she sits in a chair while hidden, others ignore the chair, taking other seats or standing but failing to notice her innocuous presence or the mysteriously empty' seat. This concealment is generally broken if the hidden individual deliberately interacts with the environment, by picking up or dropping something, speaking to someone, touching a person or manipulating an object-the amount of concealable activity varies with this Discipline's power, as shown in the individual levels. The concealment of Obfuscate functions against all of the senses, because it actually forces attention away from the hidden individual. Thus, the presence of a Nosferatu wandering about with Unseen Presence is not betrayed by any telltale odor of the sewers.  Cross your arms in front of your chest to represent your use of Obfuscate, displaying a number of fingers on each hand corresponding to your highest level of power (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for Advanced).  The Discipline of Auspex can sometimes be used to pierce the veil of Obfuscate. An individual with Auspex (or a similar power of supernatural sensitivity) may penetrate Obfuscate if he is already looking for hidden individuals. The searcher may engage in a Mental Challenge with the hidden subject. For each level of difference between the subject's Obfuscate and the searcher's Auspex, there is a Trait modifier on a one-for-one basis to the outcome of ties or overbids. If the searcher wins, then he pierces the Obfuscate and senses the hidden vampire normally. If the concealed individual wins, the searcher remains oblivious to her presence. Thus, ifa vampire with Vanish from the Mind's Eye (an Intermediate power) uses Obfuscate while trying to evade a vampire with only Heightened Senses (a Basic power), the hiding vampire gains a two-Trait bonus on the Mental Challenge, and if successful, he remains unseen. This bonus applies even if the sneaking vampire uses a lower level of Obfuscate than he actually possesses, so using Unseen Presence is still potent against low levels of Auspex if the vampire actually has Intermediate or Advanced Obfuscate. Similarly, simple Heightened Senses and the like gain the full benefit of the vampire's best level of Auspex, so a vampire with Psychic Projection is extremely difficult to fool, even if only using the Basic levels of sensory powers.  Obfuscate powers last as long as they are maintained, and they generally require no particular effort. These powers conceal the user and everything wom or carried. The Stealth Ability is used for retests by augmenting the Discipline with natural shadows and concealment. Hidden individuals cannot use Willpower to defend against Auspex challenges to Obfuscate (they cannot ‘will them selves’ into a more hidden state). ",

While using the Mask of a Thousand Faces, your features seem bland and unremarkable. Most often, people will describe you in vague, general terms relating to your normal appearance, but without any specifics, unique features or details. (Nosferatu and Samedi in particular find this power useful for assuming a semblance of their mortal countenances.) If you expend a Mental Trait, you may assume a specific set of features instead, causing those who look on you and who do not pierce your disguise to see, hear and smell the form that you choose. Thus, you can make your hair seem to be of a different color, change your apparent facial features, or seem to exude the smell of a specific perfume (or no smell at all). Note, though, that this power does not change the appearance of anything that you wear or carry-only your physical features are obscured. A Mask of a Thousand Faces remains until you fall asleep, are knocked unconscious or torpid, or are killed.  You still use your normal Social Traits while using the Mask of a Thousand Faces. You can copy an image of fewer Traits deliberately, but if you hope to masquerade as someone with more Social Traits, you must expend Blood Traits to match that person's total Social Traits. Otherwise, your appearance and mannerisms mysteriously fail to convey the person's countenance properly. You cannot use the Mask of a Thousand Faces to assume more Social Traits than your generation would allow you to possess, so you may have difficulty duplicating the incredible grace of an elder. In either case, you still use your normal Social Traits; the assumption of the Mask of a Thousand Faces merely causes you to appear like someone of more or less social acumen and appearance."

You may vanish from view at any time, without having to seek cover. To do so, you simply declare your intent, and then make a mass Mental Challenge against any onlookers (regardless of Auspex) who care to challenge your powers - you bid one Mental Trait for each onlooker, and throw one symbol against all of them. If you succeed, you fade away, unnoticed by anyone. Even if some people notice you, you can attempt to fade from their view again on consecutive turns. Fading away with Vanish from the Mind's Eye does not count as an action, but it happens only at the end of a turn. Thus, if you strike someone and then attempt to disappear, you must wait until the end of the turn.  Additionally, you may speak aloud while using this Discipline, and still attempt to remain hidden. Again, if you speak, you must make a mass Mental Challenge against everyone trying to detect your position, regardless of Auspex.

Thus, you could choose to spread several Masks of a Thousand Faces over your allies, making them all look like different people (or even making some look like clones), or you could shroud a group with Vanish from the Mind's Eye, causing them all to fade from view. When you exert this power, you must meet all of the normal conditions for the Obfuscate that you extend-you cannot cast Cloak of Shadows over someone who is not hidden behind cover or shadows, for instance. If you cause a group of people to Vanish from the Mind's Eye, you need only make one Mental Challenge to extend the effect over your entire group. Anyone who bests you sees through the cloak, while anyone who loses to you fails to notice anyone under the cloak. You can only cast out a power that you are using, and you can only extend one power at a time.  Individuals under the effects of Cloak the Gathering still sense one another normally. Of course, a cloaked individual could use his own Obfuscate powers to remain unnoticed to other people under the cloak. If an individual under Cloak the Gathering violates the provisions of his loaned Obfuscate in some way (say, by launching an attack), then he immediately loses the benefits, but the cloak itself remains intact. Only if you violate your Obfuscate does the cloak fail. Similarly, if a character with Auspex attempts to breach your concealment, individuals noticed under the cloak do not compromise the protection for everyone else, but if you are noticed, then the entire cloak fails.  Cloak the Gathering only throws your Obfuscate over other creatures or entities.

Your form collapses into a shadowy outline, a pseudo-liquid humanoid shape of utter blackness. While in this form, you can slither about through tiny holes and cracks, and you may see through any normal darkness.  You must expend three Blood Traits and spend three full turns in concentration, doing nothing else, in order to make this transformation. While in Tenebrous Form, you cannot be harmed by physical attacks, although you still take damage from magic, fire and sunlight. You also cannot affect your surroundings physically, as you have no real solid substance. By enveloping a victim, though (with your Mental Traits challenging his Physical Traits as an attack), you can perform the same functions as the Shroud of Night power, causing disorientation, darkness and smothering. You are unaffected by gravity, and you can slither along any surface or move like a blob of ambulatory liquid. You can even use mental Disciplines while in this state, though within the limitations of your form--you have no eyes and thus cannot use Dominate, but you could hide your shadowy form with Obfuscate. In this shadow form, your Blood Traits are the same sort of inky darkness, and thus, they are unaffected by the powers of Thaumaturgy.  While in Tenebrous Form, fire and sunlight are exceedingly painful to you; thus, you suffer a one-Trait penalty on resolution of Courage Tests."

The inhuman might of Potence is sufficient to allow a vampire to break bones, shatter stone, even heft and destroy heavy or resilient objects. Vampires using Potence in battle are fearsome indeed, delivering telling blows that fell even their undead adversaries.  Most uses of Potence above the Basic levels are considered a breach of the Masquerade among Camarilla Kindred.  The Potence Discipline is most commonly known by the Brujah, Giovanni, Lasombra and Nosferatu clans, all of whom prize physical strength and prowess. As Potence is a highly useful capability and requires little effort on the part of the vampire in question, many Cainites seek out tutors in this Discipline.  The Potence Discipline, as a physically augmenting Discipline, does not use any Ability for retests other than the Ability commonly associated with whatever task is at hand. That is when striking someone while using Potence, one should use the normal Brawl Ability for retesting. ",

Doing so generally requires you to bid a strength-related Trait, such as the types of Traits restorable with Prowess. Obviously, if you cannot exert your Might, you cannot make this retest-thus, you cannot use Might at range, with a thrown object (requiring speed and accuracy). You could use Might while trying to grab at a dodging opponent, but not when picking up and throwing a heavy object."

More than simply using intrigue or carefully rehearsed acting to influence others, vampires with Presence literally project auras of power or dread.  The Presence Discipline is most common among vampires of the Brujah, Follower of Set, Toreador and Ventru clans. Brujah often use Presence to whip mobs into righteous anger, while Followers of Set influence their customers subtly. Toreador cultivate an air of artistic beauty, and Ventrue rely on their control of emotions to influence and rule their 'subjects.'  Unlike Dominate, which affects the rational mind directly, Presence affects emotions. Thus, it is a more subtle form of control. However, subjects of Presence are less predictable than Dominate victims. Also, whereas Dominate requires that the victim see the user's eyes, Presence usually requires only that the user's face be visible -some Presence powers do not even require that much exposure.

Your victim need not see you, or even be seen by you - as long as the subject is known to you, you can Summon him to your side. Once called, the subject tries to get to you by whatever means possible, completely unaware of the supernatural nature of the desire and avoiding situations that would prevent fulfilling the compulsion (like locked rooms and overprotective allies). The compulsion lasts until the victim manages to arrive and make his presence known to you.  To Summon someone, you must ask for a Narrator's assistance. Inform the Narrator of the person that you wish to Summon, as well as your number of Social Traits and whether you are using the Leadership Ability. The Narrator then finds the subject, performing a Social Challenge in your stead and using the Leadership Ability for a retest if necessary. If the challenge succeeds, the subject comes to you as previously described. If the challenge fails, the subject manages to resist the Summon. In either case, you have no knowledge of the outcome, so there is no guarantee of success. Of course, if the subject does not appear, you can wait five minutes and then attempt to Summon the victim again.  You can only Summon someone that you know-at bare minimum, someone that you have had the chance to talk with for a few minutes, or someone who has been a target of your presence powers before. If another individual then uses Summon on your subject, the victim heads to the summoner of the most powerful generation; if multiple summoners are of the same generation, the victim goes to the first one to exert the power. Should two vampires of equal generation simultaneously Summon the same victim, then the Narrator should make a Social Challenge between the two, with the victim heading to the victor.  In the unusual case that Summon is used on a false identity (an identity created with Mask of a Thousand Faces, for instance), the Summon still brings the appropriate individual. If multiple individuals use the same false identity, then the first Summon calls whichever is nearest (generally, whichever one a Narrator finds first), and any further Summons then call the same individual. Thus, if three Malkavians using Mask of a Thousand Faces all pretend to be the same imaginary person, a Summon of that person brings whichever of the Malkavians is nearest and then calls that Malkavian for any future uses of Summon."

Due to the hideous nature of your snake-form, you gain the Negative Social Traits Bestial and Repugnant while in this form. Obviously, being in this form rips the Masquerade wide open if you're spotted by mortals.  The Skin of the Adder remains in effect until you decide to transform back, or until the next sunrise."

As you have already cheated death with your immortality, you can now cheat this judgment as well. On the new moon, you can pull your very heart from your unliving body, with several hours of surgery (out of play), you can even do the same to another vampire.  No test is necessary to remove the heart, but the subject must be willing. While most vampiric flesh rots and decays in a single turn after being separated from the body, the withered heart coaxed forth with this power remains intact. Anyone whose heart is removed in this fashion is therefore immune to staking. Most often, the Setite carefully places the heart in a guarded clay urn, perhaps surrounded by other false hearts to avoid discovery.  As the heart is considered the seat of emotion, you gain a bonus Trait in Virtue Tests to resist frenzy. However, you also lose any Empathy Abilities, plus any Social Traits relating to warm interactions with people, such Friendly, Empathetic or Genial.  If a separated heart is staked, then its vampiric owner (the vampire that the heart originally came from) is immediately paralyzed. Should the heart be exposed to fire or sunlight (even a single health level's worth), it is destroyed and its owner erupts into flame, reduced to ash (and Final Death) in a single turn.  Use of The Heart of Darkness can also return a stolen heart to its former body. Obviously, trying to use this power on a mortal, even a ghoul, is messily fatal."

The Samedi bloodline practices this nightmare Discipline, using its powers to control the very steps of death and decay. Indeed, fearful Cainites whisper that Thanatosis grants some control over the Curse itself, temporarily suspending the immortality of vampires and even reducing them to rotting masses.  The Stiffs do not share their secrets of death, though mercenary Samedi are more than willing to visit the discomfort of Thanatosis briefly on too-curious subjects. This Discipline seems to be a natural outgrowth of the Samedi fascination with death and decay. Strangely, other Cainites who unearth this Discipline do not suffer from the rotting affliction of the Stiffs, leading to some speculation that the bloodline suffers its peculiar curse for other, more sinister, reasons.  Retests of Thanatosis involve the Occult Ability. Optionally, Storytellers may choose to use the more specialized Thanatology Ability for Thanatosis retests",

You can vaguely sense your surroundings (about 10 feet in all directions) at this time, and you are completely immune to physical attacks, fire and sunlight.

    "Thaumaturgy" : {
        "description" : "Vampires are creatures of magic, and tales in the Book of Nod tell of rituals and powers unknown to the common spate of Disciplines. For the most part, such strange capabilities -controlling the weather, altering one's own blood, casting mystical lights and so on remained the province of apocryphal tales. A rare few vampires learned to harness the power of their blood to perform magic, but most used only the gifts granted by the Curse.  In the Dark Ages, though, the Tremere clan rose to prominence through the use of Thaumaturgy. By combining their mortal wizardly knowledge with their new-foundpowers of blood, the Tremere discovered ways to control the manipulation of vitae, forcing it to perform specialized powers. Furthermore, with careful rituals, they were able to create wide ranging effects, much like the powerful spells attributed to legendary sorcerers.  The Discipline of Thaumaturgy is the study of vampiric magic, the ability to shape the forces of vitae into directed mystical energy. Pioneered primarily by the Tremere, the Discipline is actually composed of several 'paths.' Each path represents a particular area of magical study: blood manipulation, fire control, warding or other, stranger effects.  When learning Thaumaturgy, you must specify one path as your primary path of study. Whenever you improve your Thaumaturgy, you improve your capabilities with that path. However, you can learn additional paths just like other Disciplines. You can never be as skilled in your additional paths as you are in your primary area of study, though, until you master Thaumaturgy. Thus, you cannot study additional paths until you have learned Intermediate Thaumaturgy in your primary path, and your secondary paths cannot exceed the Basic levels until you attain Advanced Thaumaturgy in the studies of your primary path. Once you learn Advanced Thaumaturgy, you may improve any of your other paths to the Advanced level as well through the use of Experience.  Thaumaturgy is the province of the Tremere clan, and they guard their wizardly secrets jealousy. Indeed, learning even the rudiments of Thaumaturgy can take a year or more for vampires unskilled in the Tremere's arcane ways. The Tremere do not teach this Discipline to those outside their clan; vampires who wish to study Thamanergy must find a traitor to the Tremere or else engage in decades of intensive research with the rarest of occult materials and books. However, a few vampires outside the Tremere clan do study.  Thaumaturgy. Most notably, some Assamite viziers have learned to cast Thaumaturgy as a result of their studies of the Tremere curse and its underlying magic; however, as this magic is not native to them, their forms of Thaumaturgy always cost an extra Blood Trait. Within the Sabbat, some rare Tzimisce calling themselves koldun study the ways of Thaumanagy that were brought by former Tremere defectors. Rumors hold that true koldun actually study a completely different form of sorcery, far older than Tremere Thaumaturgy, but none would ever wish to meet a Tzimisce old and twisted enough to know the truth of such matters.  In game terms, vampiric magic is usually referred to as Thaumaturgy, though not all Thaumaturgy is the same. A form of corrupting magic is supposedly practiced by the Followers of Set, for instance, yet it is totally different from and incompatible with the practices of Tremere magic. Of course, this fact does not stop the Tremere from using their knowledge to develop duplicates of such powers. This flexibility to devise paths (duplicating or opposing nearly any Discipline) is, perhaps, the greatest strength of Thaumaturgy.  The majority of Tremere neonates start learning the Path of Blood as their primary Thaumaturgy path, but a few start with other areas. Still, the sheer usefulness of the Path of Blood makes it more valuable than other specialised abilities.  Any use of Thaumaturgy requires the expenditure of a Blood Trait. Some specific powers may require additional expenditures as well. Thaumaturgy does rely on speaking magical phrases and gestures, and as such its use is generally noticeable. Unless otherwise noted, casting Thaumaturgy takes a full turn, and the magic takes effect at the time of your action. You cannot accelerate Thaumaturgy with speed enhancing powers such as Celerity.",

When used on mortals, ghouls, revenants and vampires of weaker generation than the user, Vicissitude's effects are permanent. Vampires of equal or more potent generations can heal back each Vicissitude-inflicted scar as an aggravated wound. Of course, a user of this Discipline can always shape his own flesh as desired.  Nosferatu, Samedi and vampires with similar deformities in their blood always heal back alterations of Vicissitude that attempt to improve their appearances. The Curse of Caine is not so easily circumvented.  Vicissitude uses the Crafts: Body Crafts Ability for retests. Most Vicissitude effects require physical contact and a Physical Challenge as the vampire tears into the flesh of the opponent. Such strikes use Crafts: Body Crafts for retests, instead of Brawl, since the aim is to mutate the flesh.
