    "description" : "Mortal society builds on institutions. As humans raise their cities, they form gatherings of expertise that are manipulated by the Cainites hiding in their midst. If you have Influence, you can sway the direction of some areas of mortal society, pushing cities to grow as you direct. Your Influence can be used to strike indirectly at your foes while protecting your own assets, or to gain information and special resources.  Influence comes in many different areas. You must allocate Traits separately to each Influence; thus, if you have Legal x 4, you could still have Police x3 independently but you would have to spend the Traits for each.  You cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical, Social and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of your total Influence--your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are only so many things you can do in a night.  When you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The tables for various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of Traits. Performing an action requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the action; you must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level of an Influence chart, for instance. Thus, with high levels of Influence, you can perform many small actions, or a few significant ones.  Certain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the Resources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not come automatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you must direct your Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not come with any associated trappings of wealth (you'd have to buy a house and car separately, for instance). Aides garnered with Influence generally help only for one specific task, and they usually only have the equivalent of one level of Ability in their area of skill - for more competent and readily available help, take Allies.  Most cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For instance, Atlanta has a great deal of Transportation Influence, because it is a hub of travel, while Hollywood would have a lot of High Society and Media Influence. A Rust-Belt city where manufacturing and heavy industry has all but disappeared would have very little to no Industry Influence.  Storytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in the city. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more is to use Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring investment), to destroy someone else's Influence and thus free up those resources, or to acquire an adversary's Influence in an area. Also, each city may have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving independent film community is going to have a different picture of Media or High Society than a city where the arts are being literally starved out due to budget cuts.  Each area of Influence has its own description. Elder vampires may possess truly far reaching Influence, giving them the power to exert control beyond the levels included here.",
