To purchase a Merit, you must expend Free Traits equal to the cost of the Merit; taking a Flaw,conversely, hinders you with a handicap of some sort, but it offers additional Free Traits.

This Flaw necessitates some method of restraining your prey. The torture that you inflict on your victims can be considered a form of suffering, and it may be inimical to vampires with high Humanity Traits."

The Storyteller will determine a particular fate, which will invariably strike you, removing your character from play. Furthermore, in any particular session where the Storyteller deems appropriate, you may receive a vision of your impending misery. You must spend a Willpower Trait to shake off the experience, or you are a Trait down on all challenges for the rest of the session. This Flaw can be difficult to roleplay, and players are advised to think carefully before choosing it. Some may believe that this Flaw removes free will, but foreknowledge of one's demise can be quite liberating."

Sunlight inflicts double damage, and even moonlight hurts - direct moonlight causes one level of lethal damage per turn. You must use sunglasses to shield your eyes, and you tend to stick to dark places out of habit and safety."
