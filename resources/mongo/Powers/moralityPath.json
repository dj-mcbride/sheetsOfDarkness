    "name" : "Morality Paths",
    "description" : "The Embrace strips a fledgling vampire of all ties to life and humanity. Turned into an animated mockery of life that subsists on the blood of others, the new vampire can only hope to hang onto some memory of mortal morality. The feelings of compassion, the ineffable tie to life, trust and love are all cast aside by a curse that separates the vampire from the rest of humanity. With all human drives and desires twisted into a raging Beast that demands survival at any cost, only a code of morality stands between the Cainite and utter animalistic insanity.  Most vampires, thrust suddenly into undead society, cling to the trappings of their mortal lives. This Humanity guides vampires to control their urges and to hang on to the shadows of their former consciences. Indeed, many vampires, suddenly terrified by the Hunger, hold themselves to higher standards in death than in life. However, as the ages pass, emotions fade and Cainites become jaded, their Humanity flickering like a dying candle. The Humanity of the most ancient of elders hangs only by a thread, and many lose their Humanity entirely, falling into a final grand dance of frenzy and slaughter until they are put down like rabid dogs by their fellow Kindred. As a vampire loses her Humanity, she comes to resemble a pallid, desiccated corpse and is driven more by her vampire habits: sleeping deeply during the day, giving in to the lassitude of age and finding it difficult to interact with mortals as anything other than prey.  A rare few vampires have the presence of mind to set for themselves moral standards alien to humanity. As long as the Cainite holds to a rigid code of conduct, the Beast can be kept at bay. Such a restructuring of one's lifetime of morals requires incredible will and many years of dedicated study. Over the centuries, vampires have developed several such alternate moralities, called Paths of Enlightenment. These Paths cast aside all that is humane in favor of a specialized code more appropriate to the undead. Needless to say, despite their stabilizing affect, these Paths are sociopathic — indeed, their practitioners are unquestionably divorced from anything resembling mortal thought or belief. A follower of a Path may channel his vampire urges, but such channels cause instinctive fear and revulsion in mortals.  When you create a vampire character, you default to the morality of Humanity. Your Morality Traits can range from zero to five, with zero Traits indicating that the character has fallen completely to the clutches of the Beast (and is thus no longer suitable for play) and five indicating a character with a highly developed sense of morality. With the permission of a Storyteller, you can start with a Path of Enlightenment, but keep in mind that Paths are difficult and demanding to roleplay. To study a Path, your character must have at least three Willpower Traits, and he must have spent several years abandoning Humanity in favor of a new set of morals (with instruction). Paths also sometimes use different Virtues, and you may not start with as many Virtue Traits if you have Conviction or Instinct (since it takes work to strip away your human virtues in favor of these inhuman ones).  Each Path (including Humanity) has a Hierarchy of Sins. This Hierarchy elaborates on what constitutes a moral failing for its particular set of ethics. The higher the rating, the stricter the standards. Everything below that rating is automatically considered a failing if performed. Thus, a rare vampire with a Humanity of 5 doesn't need to grapple with his conscience over the notion that killing someone is wrong - he already knows that. He does, however, have qualms about putting himself first too often.  A character with several Morality Traits is distanced from the Beast, but conversely, he must hold himself to high standards of behavior, as shown by the many possible sins. With few Morality Traits, a character risks succumbing to the Beast, but trivial moral concerns are too minor to erode his morals further.  The Paths of Enlightenment in this book are often found among non-aligned vampires, or among a few vampires of any sectarian allegiance. Camarilla vampires usually uphold Humanity, though a rare few elders follow different beliefs. Vampires of the Sabbat have their own inhuman Paths of Enlightenment, which are a subject for another book.",

While she won't always go out of her way vandalize or kill, she accepts that sometimes fate has it in for some people. She does what needs doing with little griping or effort on her part to avoid it. Something the vampire's inner monster starts to shine through at this stage, causing mortals feel uncomfortable around her or manifesting some physical eeriness.",
            "2" : "Hey, some people ought to die. Killing is very acceptable this Kindred, provided the victim deserves to die (and only the vampire knows who deserving). Theft, injury, torture and destruction are tools to be used to accomplis one's goals, and one's goals are always paramount. Such a state reflects many vampire elders. The vampire begins to acquire a corpse-like aspect, and may find it difficult to interact with mortals (who often find him more than a little disturbing).",
            "1" : "The lives and property of others mean nothing to a Kindred this far gone. Such a vampire more than likely indulges in twisted pleasures, which can be all manner of atrocity. Perversion, cold blooded murder, mutilation, wickedness for it own sake are all signs of a Kindred who has not long to continue. The next frenzy may well be the last. Such a vampire may be physically mistaken for human, but only under certain conditions (such as dim lighting and plenty of distractions)."

The so-called Dervishes hunt for lore and ancient vitae, so that they may understand their enemies and take their power. Even Cainites of weak blood are not immune to the hunts the Dervishes are said to have ways of mystically preserving the vitae so that other members of their clan can use it. By stealing away the power of other vampires, the Dervishes hope to concentrate it in the hands of the faithful, who purify it through their honor.  Only old and faithful Assamites, and a few converts, study the Path of Blood. Most outsiders and neonates are completely ignorant of this path. Instruction begins only when the supplicant proves his worth and his desire to be shed of Khayyin's curse in the light of Haqim's glory.",

Death comes to all things sooner or later, so the Gravediggers study the process of physical death, the decay of the body and the extinguishing of the spirit. Practiced largely by Giovanni and some Samedi, these scholarly Cainites strive to unlock the mysteries of death, to understand why death occurs and how vampires cheat the natural cycle. Though they are neither murderers nor cavalier about death, they do occasionally “assist” if death seems to be unnaturally delayed.  Necromantic curiosity drives followers of the Path of Bones to seek out experiments and hidden lore about death. Many consort with ghosts, trying to discern the very motives of the soul. To a Gravedigger, the vampire cheats eternity. The answers to how and why this happens hold the keys to understanding all of mortality, and thus, to all existence. While the Gravediggers may be quite erudite about ghosts and thanatology, many are completely divorced from society, mortal or Cainite.  The Path of Bones upholds Conviction and Self-Control",

Kindred are believed to be locked outside of maya (the cycle of the universe). While most individuals are reincarnated through samsara, the way of rebirth, vampires have dodged this cycle. Therefore, they have also lost their svadharma, or individual purpose. Thus, it remains to the Shilmulo to determine each vampire's svadharma and get him back on that path, thus advancing maya, by whatever means necessary. If other Kindred fail to understand their svadharma, then it's up to the Ravnos to push them back into samsara. The state of undeath is considered a curse, but Ravnos believe this shruti (what has been learned from the gods) to be due to their failure to understand maya.
